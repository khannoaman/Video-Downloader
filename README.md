Video Downloader 
===================

It is a program which asks for the source url of a video on any website and download it for you. Also it can convert the video from ".ts" to ".mp4" provided you have "ffmpeg.exe" saved inside you current working directory.
If the source url of the video starts with "blob" you have to provide the url of the "master.m3u8" file.
